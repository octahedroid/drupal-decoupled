    summary: 'Designers wear many hats, the first one being a moderator.',
    content: `
      <p>Designers aren't purely focused on aesthetics â€” their role encompasses broader business aspects and technology, while carefully evaluating those by estimating the return on investment for each solution.</p>
      <p>In short, designers ensure that the end value of the specific solution, or product as a whole, brings gains to the client's business as expected and a significant return against the initial investment.</p>
      <h3>Core Areas of Focus</h3>
      <p>At intive, our designers maintain this awareness by developing across three core areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Business</li>
        <li>Technology</li>
        <li>User-centric design practices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For each vertical, they keep ROI in mind, taking care to estimate and realize the impact of UX on the client's budget, goals, and wider technical framework.</p>
