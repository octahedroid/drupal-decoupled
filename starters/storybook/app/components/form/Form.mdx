# Forms

## Overview

Our form components provide a robust foundation for building accessible, validated forms across your application. These components are designed to work seamlessly with modern form validation libraries and follow best practices for user experience.

## Recommended Implementation

### Libraries

We recommend using the following libraries for form implementation:

- **[Zod](https://zod.dev/)**: A TypeScript-first schema validation library that enables you to define the shape and validation rules for your form data.
- **[Conform](https://conform.guide/)**: A form validation library designed to work with native HTML form elements, providing a great developer experience without sacrificing user experience.

### Components

The form components in this library are wrapper components built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components, specifically designed to work with Conform. These include:

- `Input`: A text input component with validation support
- `Textarea`: A multi-line text input component with validation support
- Additional form components like checkboxes, radio buttons, and select inputs

Each component is pre-configured to work with Conform's field metadata, making it simple to implement form validation.

## Client-Side vs. Server-Side Validation

The form stories in Storybook demonstrate client-side validation implementations. However, in production applications, **server-side validation is essential** for security and data integrity.

### Full Stack Components

We recommend implementing forms as full stack components, following the approach described in [Epic Web's Full Stack Components](https://www.epicweb.dev/full-stack-components). This approach ensures:

1. Consistent validation logic between client and server
2. Progressive enhancement for users without JavaScript
3. Better security by not relying solely on client-side validation

## Framework-Specific Implementation

Forms should be implemented according to the recommendations of each framework:

## Best Practices

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure forms work without JavaScript
2. **Accessibility**: Use proper labels, error messages, and ARIA attributes
3. **Validation Feedback**: Provide clear, immediate feedback for validation errors
4. **Security**: Always validate data on the server, regardless of client-side validation
5. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript and Zod to ensure type safety throughout your form handling

## Example Implementation

See the Form.stories.tsx file for a complete example of a contact form implementation using Zod and Conform.
